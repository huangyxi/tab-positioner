# Tab Positioner

**OPEN SOURCE, NO ADS, NO TRACKING!**

Tab Positioner lets you customize the position of new tabs and control which tab becomes active after a tab is closed.
It is a modern successor to the [Tab Position Options](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-position-options/fjccjnfkdkdmjohojoggodkigkjkkjhl) extension, rebuilt from the ground up to support [Chrome's new Manifest V3 platform](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/).

## Features

<!-- * **New Tab Position**: Customize where newly created tabs appear. -->
<!-- * **Link Tab Position**: Set a separate rule for tabs opened from links. -->
<!-- * **Tab Activation**: Choose which tab becomes active after you close one. -->
* **Sync Settings**: Your tab position preferences are synced across all your devices, via [Chrome's built-in sync feature](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277#zippy=%2Csign-in-turn-on-sync).
